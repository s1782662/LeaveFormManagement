# LeaveFormManagement


In the existing system, students have to fill the offline form, requesting for leave and get it approved from the concerned authorities in order to leave the campus. The issue behind applying for leave through an offline form was, time-consuming. Students have to maintain a long tiresome queue for the authorities to get it approved.

This project helps students to apply for leave via an online form. The system creates an environment where concerned authorities are notified if the student applies for leave.  It saves lots of paper and keeps a record of students whereabouts. The system can be remotely operated even with a mobile browser and get the job done only with a simple 4-5 clicks.
